# Personality Clustering with Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning system to group users into **five personality-based clusters** using the **OCEAN** model (Big Five Personality Traits). The goal is to provide a detailed behavioral analysis that can be applied in various scenarios, such as evaluating candidates for Human Resources teams.

## Overview
The system analyzes and groups users based on their personality traits, classified under the OCEAN model:

- **O**penness
- **C**onscientiousness
- **E**xtraversion
- **A**greeableness
- **N**euroticism

By clustering users into **five distinct groups**, the project enables a deeper understanding of user behavior, assisting organizations in decision-making processes such as:
- Candidate evaluation (HR)
- Targeted marketing
- Personalized recommendations
